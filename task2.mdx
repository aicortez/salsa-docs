# Component selection
- Added Cards to Highlight important things.
- Dropdowns to make it easy to navigate between multiple items.
- Added Update component and enabled RSS for changelog page.
- Replaced regular notes and warnings with the Callouts components.
- Added Steps component to migration section to make it easier to follow the process.

# UX Enhancements
- Moved API endpoints to their own pages separated into different sections to reduce clutter and improve readability.
- Generated API endpoint pages with necessary headers, parameters, and response examples for better developer experience.
- Generated a few missing sections such as the Best Practices section in the quality page and the Account Locked section in the troubleshooting page.

# Styling decisions
- It was hard to decide which sections needed to be highlighted with components. It can be easy to overuse them and make the page look cluttered so I focused on using them for the sections I thought were the most important and would benefit the most from the styling.
- I also wanted to make sure the styling was consistent across all pages, so I used the same components and styling choices throughout the documentation.
- A good way of choosing which components to use was to define what is each component good for. For example, Cards to highlight important features, Callouts for important notes, tips and warnings, Steps for processes that require numbered steps, Accordions for FAQ sections, etc.
- Created a logo to give it a more polished look and feel.
