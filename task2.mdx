# Component selection

- Dropdowns to make it easy to navigate between multiple items.
- Added Update component and enabled RSS for changelog page.
- Replaced regular notes and warnings with the Callouts components.
- Added Steps component to migration section to make it easier to follow the process.

# UX Enhancements
- Moved API endpoints to their own pages separated into different sections to reduce clutter and improve readability.
- Generated API endpoint pages with necessary headers, parameters, and response examples for better developer experience.
- Generated a few missing sections:
    - [Best Practices](https://localhost:3000/v2/quality#best-practices)
    - [Account Locked](http://localhost:3000/v2/troubleshooting#account-locked)
    - [Certified Hardware Partners](https://localhost:3000/v2/integrations#certified-hardware-partners)
    - [Sensor Types and Capabilities](https://localhost:3000/v2/advanced-usage#sensor-types-and-capabilities)
    <Info>These sections were generated by AI</Info>
- Replaced all codeblocks with CodeGroup components including Javascript, Python and PHP examples to all of them considering these are the three SDKs the company provides.
- Removed links from non-existent pages.

# Styling decisions
- It was hard to decide which sections needed to be highlighted with components. It can be easy to overuse them and make the page look cluttered so I focused on using them for the sections I thought were the most important and would benefit the most from the styling.
- I also wanted to make sure the styling was consistent across all pages, so I used the same components and styling choices throughout the documentation.
- A good way of choosing which components to use was to define what is each component good for. For example, Cards to highlight important features, Callouts for important notes, tips and warnings, Steps for processes that require numbered steps, Accordions for FAQ sections, etc.
- Created a logo, changed the theme to `maple` and changed the colors to give it a more polished look and feel.
- I felt that the pricing page was easier to read with tabs for each plan, highlighting the main differences between them.
- I also tried not to change the page contents too much. Most of the contents match the original ones, I just worked on styling/formatting and made slight changes only when needed.
