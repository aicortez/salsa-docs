### Quality Prediction

Configure AI quality monitoring to detect issues before they occur:

<CodeGroup dropdown>
```javascript
// Example: Configure quality monitoring via API
const qualityConfig = {
  enabled: true,
  monitoring_interval: "5m",  // Check every 5 minutes
  thresholds: {
    temperature: { min: 35, max: 40, unit: "F" },
    freshness_score: { min: 8.0, max: 10.0 },
    consistency: { min: 7.5 }
  },
  alert_channels: ["email", "sms", "push", "slack"],
  auto_action: {
    low_quality_detected: "pause_production",
    temperature_violation: "notify_manager"
  }
};
```

```python
# Example: Configure quality monitoring via Python
quality_config = {
    "enabled": True,
    "monitoring_interval": "5m",  # Check every 5 minutes
    "thresholds": {
        "temperature": {"min": 35, "max": 40, "unit": "F"},
        "freshness_score": {"min": 8.0, "max": 10.0},
        "consistency": {"min": 7.5}
    },
    "alert_channels": ["email", "sms", "push", "slack"],
    "auto_action": {
        "low_quality_detected": "pause_production",
        "temperature_violation": "notify_manager"
    }
}
```

```php
// Example: Configure quality monitoring via PHP
$qualityConfig = [
    "enabled" => true,
    "monitoring_interval" => "5m",  // Check every 5 minutes
    "thresholds" => [
        "temperature" => ["min" => 35, "max" => 40, "unit" => "F"],
        "freshness_score" => ["min" => 8.0, "max" => 10.0],
        "consistency" => ["min" => 7.5]
    ],
    "alert_channels" => ["email", "sms", "push", "slack"],
    "auto_action" => [
