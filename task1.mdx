# Decision-making

My main goal was to make it easier for someone new to navigate the docs.

I focused on two things: making the guides easy to find and giving the API documentation a dedicated home. This led me to split the navigation into three main pages:

- **Home**
- **API Reference**
- **Changelog**

### Home

Since this is the landing page, it needs to be the central spot where users can quickly find what they need. I split it into three sub-sections:

- **Getting Started:** Explains what the service is and how to use it, including pricing, integrations, and troubleshooting.
- **Guides:** A dedicated spot for all product-specific guides.
- **Core Features:** These are the primary use-cases for "Salsa as a Service." Because these are the main features the app offers, they need their own section to stand out.

### API Reference

The API documentation needs its own space. Making it a separate tab ensures users can access it easily, regardless of which page they’re on.

### Changelog

I think it’s important to highlight product improvements and bug fixes. Giving the changelog its own spot makes it easy for users to check in, try out new features, learn about API changes, and see when things get fixed.

## Key Improvements

### Easy Navigation

I think this is the most important part of any website, especially documentation. A good documentation structure lets users find what they need faster, and will help them resolve things on their own.

### Version and Language Switching

This is pretty standard, but I made sure to include the version and language navigation component that Mintlify offers to keep the docs user-friendly.

## Trade-Offs & Scaling

I spent a lot of time thinking about how to group the pages within the Home section. I debated merging "Getting Started" and "Guides" into one "Overview" page, but I decided to split them so the docs are easier to scale later on.

This turned out to be a good call because it works perfectly for both v1 and v2. As we add more guides, core features, or API endpoints, they’ll naturally fit into these existing sections without making the sidebar feel cluttered.

I also thought about moving the default english pages into an /en folder but I noticed that the documentation mentioned that it was fine to leave the default language pages in the root folder.
