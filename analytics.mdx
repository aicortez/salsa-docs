console.log(`Predicted demand for next 14 days: ${forecast.predictions}`);
```

```python
# Example: Get AI demand forecast
forecast = salsa.ai.analytics.get_ai_forecast(
    location="loc_123",
    days=14
)
print(f"Predicted demand for next 14 days: {forecast.predictions}")
```

```php
// Example: Get AI demand forecast
$forecast = $salsa->ai->analytics->getAIForecast([
    'location' => 'loc_123',
    'days' => 14
]);
echo "Predicted demand for next 14 days: " . $forecast->predictions;
```
</CodeGroup>
